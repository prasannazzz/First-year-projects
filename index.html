      How can I stop overthinking and take action more quickly?
      
    </p>
    <p>
      (if one really wants to find solution to his/her overthinking aspects this must be end to it) I was is same state of mind , but this was a clear cut solution to it, though the depth touched by Mr. Steve and attempt to make us feel his way of looking at things when he was detected with 3rd stage of cancer is great! Morning must begin by thinking God's grace has provided me a spirit of humanly powers of 5 senses which are considered to be the best things any living species have availed ny nature, so this must be utilized in proper work throughout the day, thinking that today I have this, tomorrow might may not who knows?! Nights must be ended with satisfaction about things you weren't wishing to go good but got amazingly well ... If each day would pass with broadly understanding the philosophy of how life works, one could swiftly move mountains by his simple small innumerable efforts his puts on daily basis.

      Btw, I myself got a lot of clarity in it by writing this out...
